=====================

My First Plugin For OMV, Shoutcast DNAS Plugin

Shoutcast is an open source audio streaming server available from www.shoutcast.com
It allows the user to stream audio in a variety of formats from any pc, or laptop, to the Shoutcast DNAS server.

This plugin will be available for OpenMediaVault users, to allow them to share their media within their home, or while 
out working, or on the town.
